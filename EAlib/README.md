# EAlib

## Installation

We have tested this using GCC 12. Other compilers may work, but have not been tested. 
Requires at least a recent compiler that supports C++17 features, e.g.:
* GCC 9
* MSVC 19 or greater
* clang 10 or greater.

Note, while the conda environment contains a recent version of GCC, which should work, we have noticed that in certain cases this compiler is NOT selected. This is potentially due to g++ being missing, or some other hiccups, causing conan to select the wrong compiler, overriding meson's compiler selection. Installing `g++` explicitly into the conda environment may help. If this does not work, take a look at `meson-native-patch.py` which explicitly updates these paths.

Build is done through meson. If not installed, install meson and ninja using `pip install meson ninja`.

### Compling
- Follow the commands in `install.sh` for the initial setup.
- After initial setup `meson compile -C <dir>` or `meson install -C <dir>` should suffice for incremental recompilation.
