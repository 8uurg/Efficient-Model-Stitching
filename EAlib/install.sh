#  DAEDALUS â€“ Distributed and Automated Evolutionary Deep Architecture Learning with Unprecedented Scalability
# 
# This research code was developed as part of the research programme Open Technology Programme with project number 18373, which was financed by the Dutch Research Council (NWO), Elekta, and Ortec Logiqcare.
# 
# Project leaders: Peter A.N. Bosman, Tanja Alderliesten
# Researchers: Alex Chebykin, Arthur Guijt, Vangelis Kostoulas
# Main code developer: Arthur Guijt

# Change directory to the directory this file is located in.
cd $(dirname $(readlink -f "$0")) >/dev/null
# Ask conan to install dependency packages
conan install . --output-folder=build-conan --build=missing
# Use meson to configure & setup build - using dependencies provided by conan
# Tell meson to detect whether we are using a venv or not (otherwise it will try to install it in the system python installation)
meson setup build-debug --buildtype=debug --native-file build-conan/conan_meson_native.ini 
meson configure build-debug --python.install-env=auto
meson setup build --buildtype=debugoptimized --native-file build-conan/conan_meson_native.ini
meson configure build --python.install-env=auto
meson setup build-release --buildtype=release --native-file build-conan/conan_meson_native.ini
meson configure build-release --python.install-env=auto
# Note that conda environements set quite a few flags using environment variables, overriding meson's, unset them.
# unset CFLAGS
# unset CXXFLAGS
# Compiling the package should now be as easy as
meson compile -C build
# And installation (which will also recompile, if necessary)
meson install -C build
